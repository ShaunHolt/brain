Instead, was created an interface to a metamodel that is more intuitive and extends some original elements of AIML, which gives the user greater productivity without losing the power of pure AIML.\r\n\r\nThis metamodel is a generic abstraction of what we call \"atomic knowledge\" and, in the future, may be converted into other structures of computational cognition besides the worldwide used AIML.\r\n\r\n\"Atomic knowledge\" is the result of the maximum implementation of the \"divide and conquer\" strategy in the practice modeling knowledge base. It is not the farthest leaf on the knowledge's tree, but that knowledge wich has been divided in a way that the matter that remains to be addressing is already very specific. It is the knowledge that addresses one and only one aspect of a greater knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe modeling is part of the process of creating the knowledge base itself, and is synchronized with the real robot base.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge is represented graphically by means of a mental map which allows you to be modeled with fine granularity can be divided into several smaller knowledge, where each is very specific in its focus on only one aspect of a greater knowledge.\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n- Does not require knowledge of AIML;\r\n- Allows the modeling of the knowledge base;\r\n- Allows you to have an overview of the knowledge base;\r\n- Allows you to work with a very large base;\r\n- It's simpler, more intuitive and more productive than any other AIML content generator;\r\n- Encourages the creation of much content as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version\r\nThe Brain is currently in a very early version, now he does not have a tenth of its functionality implemented, but will evolve as my availability for the project and as I'm getting feedbacks from their users.\r\n\r\nThanks to use the Brain.\r\n\r\n## For researchers and developers in the area\r\nMy goals with this project are: \r\n\r\n- Contribute to strengthening this area of science \r\n- Popularizing the technology \r\n- Suggest a new way to think about generation knowledge base of chatbots (currently only AIML). \r\n\r\nI am available to assist in any way possible. Please, feel free to get in contact.\r\n","google":"UA-47304633-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
