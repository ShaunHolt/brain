                <b>Modeling the Knowledge Base</b><br>

                <p>On <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b>, <i>modeling</i> is the graphical
                    representation of <i>knowledge</i>, its relationships
                    with other <i>knowledges</i> ( parents and children ) and
                    the <i>topics</i> in which it is divided, all through
                    a mental map. The <i>modeling</i> is part of the process of
                    creating the <i>knowledge base</i> itself, and it is
                    synchronized with the robot's real base.</p>

                <p>Modeling the knowledge base of a chatbot is not
                    exactly a trivial task, since there is a set of
                    variables that directly affect the effectiveness of
                    a good human-robot interaction, such as the richness
                    of the vocabulary of both, or the clarity and
                    objectivity of messages of either the
                    specialization or generalization expected by an user
                    on a particular subject, etc. Also certain subjects
                    may be too complex or too large to be handled by a
                    robot.</p>

               <p>Considering that, <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b> was designed to
                    facilitate this task by adopting the strategy 
                    "divide and conquer". By dividing, the knowledge can
                    be modeled with very fine granularity, being reduced
                    to several small knowledges ( which we call "atomic
                    knowledge" ) where each one is very specific, since
                    it focuses only on a particular aspect of a greater
                    knowledge. Some of the advantages of this approach
                    is to have a broader view on knowledge and be much
                    easier to define all the topics covered by it. The
                    result of this approach is a much more solid base
                    and complete knowledge.</p>

                <p>But the most important for the base to be well
                    modeled is that the botmaster master each knowledge
                    he wants to model. Must already have very clear in
                    his mind what he wants to represent through of 
                    <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b>'s mental map. Below is an outline of the
                    modeling process:</p>

                <ol style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>Define a target audience ;</li>
                    <li>Define the subjects of interest to this target audience;</li>
                    <li>Define the scope of subjects ( knowledge to be modeled );</li>
                    <li>For each item of scope ( all knowledge ):</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Understand the knowledge that will be added;</li>
                        <li>Define the relationships ( parents and children );</li>
                        <li>Define the topics.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>


                <p><b>Understanding the behavior of the knowledge base</b></p>
                The <i>knowledge base</i> has a very dynamic viewing behavior. 
                This dynamism is specifically
                designed to increase user productivity when modeling the
                base or creating lessons, and covers the following
                behaviors:
                
                <p>1. Selective Display</p>
                <p><i>Knowledges</i> are automatically displayed or
                    hidden as relevant it is to clicked <i>knowledge</i>. In this way only the
                    most relevant are displayed, hence that the screen does
                    not get tiring by display a lot of information and
                    hence the user can focus only on what really matters.</p>

                <p>2. Visual Contextualization</p>
                <p>When the user clicks a <i>knowledge</i>, <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b>
                    automatically selects all its <i>knowledge</i> parents,
                    leaving all the way from the <i>Root</i> until itself 
                    with a different color from the others. This
                    is to facilitate the user's contextualization on
                    the <i>knowledge</i> that was selected.</p>
                    
                <p>3. Automatic Coloring</p>
                <p>The color of a <i>knowledge</i> changes automatically with
                    the amount of its internal <i>knowledges</i>,
                    starting light and going darker depending of increase on the
                    amount of its internal <i>knowledges</i>.</p>
                    
                <p><b>The Knowledge</b></p>
                <p>On <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b>, <i>knowledge</i> is an object that
                    encapsulates the descriptions about something. It
                    can be part of a greater <i>knowledge</i> and can also be
                    composed of other smaller <i>knowledges</i>. Internally
                    it is divided into <i>topics</i>.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the processing of either complex subjects or
                    larger subjects, <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b> uses the "Divide and Conquer"
                    strategy. Thus, how much more fragmented and specific a
                    <i>knowledge</i> is, i.e., how much more <i>topics</i> and
                    children <i>knowledges</i> it has, better is the domain of 
                    robot on it.</p>

                <p><b>Adding a Knowledge</b></p>
                <p>Note: On <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b>, there are no isolated <i>knowledge</i>,
                    all <i>knowledge</i> is necessarily connected to another,
                    being <i>Root</i> the most basic, from which all derive.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on an existing <i>knowledge</i>;</li>
                    <li>Click on "Add a Knowledge" option;</li>
                    <li>Enter the name of new <i>knowledge</i>;</li>
                    <li>Click "Save".</li>
                </ol>

                <p><b>Renaming a Knowledge</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on the <i>knowledge</i> you want to update;</li>
                    <li>Click on "Rename this Knowledge" option;</li>
                    <li>Type the new name;</li>
                    <li>Click "Save".</li>
                </ol>

                <p><b>Deleting a Knowledge</b></p>
                Attention: When a <i>knowledge</i> is deleted, it are also deleted
                in cascade all its children <i>knowledges</i>, its <i>topics</i> and
                its <i>teachings</i>.
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on the <i>knowledge</i> that you want to delete;
                    <li>Click the on "Delete this Knowledge" option;
                    <li>Click "Yes".
                </ol>

                <p><b>Topics</b></p>
                <p>Note: <i>Topic</i> is a group of <i>teachings</i>, an internal
                    division of a <i>knowledge</i>, and it is specific only to
                    the <i>knowledge</i> which it belongs to. Thus, for creating,
                    editing or deleting a <i>topic</i> you must access this
                    screen through the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on the <i>knowledge</i> you want divide;</li>
                    <li>Click on "Topics & Teachings" option;</li>
                    <li>Wait loading the <i>Topics</i> panel.</li>

                <p>At first, the robot should be seen like a child:
                    initially it has no knowledge, but starts to acquire it
                    from the teachings that are passed to them.</p>
                    
                <p><i>Teaching</i> is the smallest unit of <i>knowledge</i>
                    passed to robot. It is the statement itself of
                    what the robot should do according to the text typed by the

                                in the example above ("<i>When the

                                empty when the previous robot sentence
                                is not relevant.</p>

                                in memory during the chat session. Such
                                key informations are composed of three
                                parts, all required and in this order:</p>

                                    must be memorized.</li>

                                instruction per line. To retrieve the
                                content of a variable, use the <i>get syntax</i>: <i>${variableName}</i>.

                                should say when the user types any of

                                "When the user says". May be entered
                                several responses at once, only one
                                per line. This approach enables the
                                robot to give different answers to the
                                same user sentence, because this response is
                                the result of a random selection among
                                several possible answers registered.
                                Hence, how much more responses
                                registered, greater is the
                                "intelligence" of the robot.</p>

                                May be used the <i>get syntax</i> (both
                                ${variableName} and ${*index}).</p>
                            <p>For example, even for the <i>topic</i> "favorite
                                movies", the following sentences may be
                                entered as an robot answer:</p>
<textarea rows="4" cols="22" readonly="readonly">${favoriteMovie}?? It is my favorite too!

                </ol>
                <p>Here is a complete example:</p>
<pre>
When the user says:

  <i>(or)</i> My favorite is *

Responding to:

                <p>This is where all the robot's <i>knowledge</i> is stored
                    in and it is represented graphically through a mental
                    map.</p>
                
                <b>Knowledge</b>
                <p>On <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b>, the <i>knowledge</i> is an object that
                    encapsulates the descriptions about something. It
                    can be part of a greater <i>knowledge</i> and can also be
                    composed of other smaller <i>knowledges</i>. Internally it is divided into <i>topics</i>.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the processing of either complex subjects or
                    larger subjects, <b style="color: #727272">Brain</b> uses the "Divide and Conquer"
                    strategy. Thus, how much more fragmented and specific a
                    <i>knowledge</i> is, i.e., how much more <i>topics</i> and
                    children <i>knowledges</i> it has, better is the domain of 
                    robot on it.</p>
                    
                <b>Topic</b>
                <p><i>Topic</i> is a group of <i>teachings</i>, an internal
                    division of a <i>knowledge</i>, and it is specific only to
                    the <i>knowledge</i> which it belongs to.</p>
                    
                <b>Teaching</b>
                <p><i>Teaching</i> is the smallest unit of <i>knowledge</i>
                    passed to robot. It is the statement itself of
                    what the robot should do according to the text typed by the
                    chat's user. The <i>teachings</i> are that really prepare the
                    robot to handle the situations created by users.</p>

                <p><i>Teaching</i> is specific to just one <i>topic</i>, so it
                    only makes sense for that <i>topic</i> to which it belongs
                    to.</p>
                
                <b>Normalization</b>
                <i>( Not implemented yet. )</i>
                <p>It is the process of standardization of the text
                    typed by the user, adapting this text to certain
                    rules of writing and grammar used by the robot.
                    Normalization basically operates in the following
                    points:</p>
                <table style="width: 100%">
