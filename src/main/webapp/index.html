                <b>Modeling the Knowledge Base</b><br>

                <p>In the Brain, modeling is the graphical
                    representation of the knowledge, their relationships
                    with other knowledges ( parents and children ) and
                    the topics in which the same is divided, all through
                    a mental map. The modeling is part of the process of
                    creating the knowledge base itself, and is
                    synchronized with the robot's real base.</p>

                <p>Model the knowledge base of a chatbot is not
                    exactly a trivial task, since there is a set of
                    variables that directly affect the effectiveness of
                    a good human-robot interaction, such as the richness
                    of the vocabulary of both, or the clarity and
                    objectivity of messages of both, or the
                    specialization or generalization expected by a user
                    on a particular subject, etc. Also certain subjects
                    may be too complex or too large to be handled by a
                    robot.</p>

                <p>Thinking about that, the Brain was designed to
                    facilitate this task by adopting the strategy of
                    "divide and conquer". By dividing, the knowledge can
                    be modeled with very fine granularity, being reduced
                    to several small knowledges ( which we call "atomic
                    knowledge" ) where each is very specific, since
                    focuses only on a particular aspect of a greater
                    knowledge. Some of the advantages of this approach
                    is to have a broader view on knowledge and be much
                    easier to define all the topics covered by it. The
                    result of this approach is a much more solid base
                    and complete knowledge.</p>

                <p>But the most important for the base to be well
                    modeled is that the botmaster master each knowledge
                    he wants to model. Must already have very clear in
                    his mind what he wants to represent through the
                    mental map of the Brain. Below is an outline of the
                    modeling process:</p>

                <ol style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>Set a target audience ;</li>
                    <li>Set the topics of interest to this audience;</li>
                    <li>Define the scope of topics ( knowledge to be modeled );</li>
                    <li>For each item of scope ( all knowledge ):</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Understanding and knowledge that will be added;</li>
                        <li>Define the relationships ( upward and downward );</li>
                        <li>Set the topics.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>


                <p><b>Understanding the behavior of the knowledge base</b></p>
                The knowledge base has a very dynamic regarding their
                viewing behavior, but this dynamism is specifically
                designed to increase user productivity when modeling the
                base or creating lessons, and covers the following
                behaviors:
                
                <p>1. Selective Display</p>
                <p>The knowledges are automatically displayed or
                    hidden as relevant to clicked knowledge, so only the
                    most relevant are displayed, so that the screen does
                    not get tiring to display a lot of information and
                    so the user can focus only on what really matters.</p>

                <p>2. Visual Contextualization</p>
                <p>When the user clicks a knowledge, the Brain
                    automatically selects all its knowledge parents,
                    leaving all the way from the root until it was
                    clicked with a different color from the others. This
                    is to facilitate the user's context in relation to
                    knowledge that was selected.</p>
                    
                <p>3. Automatic Coloring</p>
                <p>The color of knowledge automatically varies with
                    the amount of internal knowledge that he has,
                    starting light and going darker depending on the
                    amount of internal knowledge increases.</p>
                    
                <p><b>The Knowledge</b></p>
                <p>In the Brain, the knowledge is an object that
                    encapsulates the descriptions about something . It
                    can be part of a larger knowledge and can also be
                    composed of other minor knowledges. Internally the
                    knowledge is divided into topics.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the processing of complex or
                    comprehensive subjects , Brain uses the strategy of
                    "Divide and Conquer". Thus how much fragmented and
                    specific a knowledge is, ie, how much topics and
                    knowledges children have that knowledge, the better
                    is the domain of robot on it.</p>

                <p><b>Adding a Knowledge</b></p>
                <p>In the Brain, there are no isolated knowledge,
                    all knowledge is necessarily connected to another,
                    being the most basic root from which all derive.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on an existing knowledge;</li>
                    <li>Click on "Add to Knowledge" option;</li>
                    <li>Enter the name of new knowledge;</li>
                    <li>Click "Save".</li>
                </ol>

                <p><b>Renaming a Knowledge</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on the Knowledge you want to update;</li>
                    <li>Click on "Rename this Knowledge" option;</li>
                    <li>Type the new name;</li>
                    <li>Click "Save".</li>
                </ol>

                <p><b>Deleting a Knowledge</b></p>
                Attention: When a knowledge is deleted, are also deleted
                in cascade all your children knowledge, its topics and
                its teachings.
                <ol>
                    <li>Right click on the knowledge that you wantto delete;
                    <li>Click the on "Delete this Knowledge" option;
                    <li>Click "Yes".
                </ol>

                <p><b>Topics</b></p>
                <p>The Topic is a group of teachings, an internal
                    division of a Knowledge, and is specific only to
                    Knowledge which it belongs to. Thus, for creating,
                    editing or deleting a Topic you must access this
                    screen through the following steps:</p>

                <p>At first, the robot should be seen as a child:
                    initially has no knowledge, but starts to acquire it
                    from the teachings that are passed to them.</p>
                    
                <p>The teaching is the smallest unit of knowledge
                    passed to the robot, it is the statement itself of
                    what he should do according to the text typed by the
                    user. Are the teachings that actually prepare the

                <p>The teaching is specific to just one topic, so it

                            <p>In this example, the robot is able to

Replying to:
   What is your favorite movie?

Say:
   It is also my favorite.
   <i>(or)</i> This is my favorite too.

                <b>Knowledge Base</b>
                <p>This is where all the robot's knowledge is stored
                    in and is represented graphically through a mental
                    map.</p>
                
                <b>Knowledge</b>
                <p>In the Brain, the knowledge is an object that
                    encapsulates the descriptions about something. It
                    can be part of a greater knowledge and can also be
                    composed of other minor knowledges. The knowledge is
                    internally divided into topics.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the processing of complex or larger
                    subjects, Brain uses the strategy of "Divide and
                    Conquer". Thus, how much fragmented and specific a
                    Knowledge is, ie, how much Topics and children have
                    that Knowledge, the better is the domain of robot on
                    it.</p>
                    
                <b>Topic</b>
                <p>The Topic is a group of Teachings, an internal
                    division of a Knowledge, and is specific only to
                    Tnowledge which it belongs to.</p>
                    
                <b>Teaching</b>
                <p>The teaching is the smallest unit of knowledge
                    passed to the robot, it is the statement itself of
                    what he should do according to the text typed by the
                    user. Are the teachings that actually prepare the
                    robot to handle situations created by users.</p>
                <p>The Teaching is specific to just one Topic, so it
                    only makes sense for that Topic to which it belongs
                    to.</p>
                
                <b>Normalization</b>
                <i>Não implementando ainda.</i>
                <p>It is the process of standardization of the text
                    typed by the user, adapting the text to certain
                    rules of writing and grammar used by the robot.
                    Normalization basically operates in the following
                    points:</p>
                <table style="width: 100%">
