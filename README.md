Brain
=====

The Brain is a system to model, create and manage the knowledge base of chatbots baseds on AIML technology.

It was designed to be a highly productive tool, so it is simple and gathers smart and harmonious way all the necessary tools for modeling and creation of the knowledge base on a single screen, and encourages generate much content as possible, both to contemplate the maximum sentences of chat`s users as to increase the robot's ability to give different answers to the same sentence of users.

It was also desgined to be a highly effective tool, so there is not direct manipulation of AIML's  sources.  Instead, was created an interface to a metamodel that is more intuitive and extends some original elements of AIML, which gives the user greater productivity without losing the power of pure AIML.

This metamodel is a generic abstraction of what we call "atomic knowledge" and, in the future, may be converted into other structures of computational cognition besides the worldwide used AIML.

"Atomic knowledge" is the result of the maximum implementation of the "divide and conquer" strategy in the practice modeling knowledge base. It is not the farthest leaf on the knowledge's tree, but that knowledge wich has been divided in a way that the matter that remains to be addressing is already very specific. It is the knowledge that addresses one and only one aspect of a greater knowledge.

The modeling is part of the process of creating the knowledge base itself, and is synchronized with the real robot base.

The knowledge is represented graphically by means of a mental map which allows you to be modeled with fine granularity can be divided into several smaller knowledge, where each is very specific in its focus on only one aspect of a greater knowledge.

### Advantages
- Does not require knowledge of AIML;
- Allows the modeling of the knowledge base;
- Allows you to have an overview of the knowledge base;
- Allows you to work with a very large base;
- It's simpler, more intuitive and more productive than any other AIML content generator;
- Encourages the creation of much content as possible.


### Version
The Brain is currently in a very early version, now he does not have a tenth of its functionality implemented, but will evolve as my availability for the project and as I'm getting feedbacks from their users.

Thanks to use the Brain.

## For researchers and developers in the area
My goals with this project are: 

- Contribute to strengthening this area of science 
- Popularizing the technology 
- Suggest a new way to think about generation knowledge base of chatbots (currently only AIML). 

I am available to assist in any way possible. Please, feel free to get in contact.
